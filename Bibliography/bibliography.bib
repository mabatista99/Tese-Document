  ABSTRACT = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and
              their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large
              number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The
              resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and
              storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional
              cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the
              IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in
              cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in
              time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing
              technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data
              processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper
              studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT),
              and then classifies them according to different factors such as
              data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data.
              Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares
              them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is
              mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in
              identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every
              architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important
              limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them.
              Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the
              edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different
              scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.},
